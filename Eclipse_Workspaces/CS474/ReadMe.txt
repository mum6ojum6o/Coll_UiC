I've created the project on Eclipse/Sublime text.
To run the project all you have to do is build all in eclipse and run it.
If at all there are existing files (1.txt,2.txt etc file name config is important!!) the VCS will load information on the basis of data present in those files.
press 'c' to create enter and store car details.
press 1 thorugh 5 to select a current car.
press 'p' to update the cost of the current car.
make sure you press 's' to ensure that the updated price is written to file on the disk.
press 'q' to quit the program.
